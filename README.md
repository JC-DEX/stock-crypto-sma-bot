*Concept: A Moving Average (MA) smooths out price data over a period. A "crossover" strategy uses two MAs: a "fast" (shorter period, e.g., 50 days) and a "slow" (longer period, e.g., 200 days).
Buy Signal: When the fast MA crosses above the slow MA, it suggests upward momentum – a potential time to buy.
Sell Signal: When the fast MA crosses below the slow MA, it suggests downward momentum – a potential time to sell.

*How to Build It (Step-by-Step):
1- Get Historical Data:
Simplest: Download a CSV file of historical stock or cryptocurrency prices (e.g., from Yahoo Finance or CoinGecko). You'll need at least 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume' columns.
Slightly Better: Use a library like yfinance (for stocks) or ccxt (for crypto) to fetch data directly in Python.

2- Calculate Moving Averages:
Use the pandas library for this; it has built-in rolling() functions.

3- Generate Signals:
Create a column for signals (e.g., 1 for buy, -1 for sell, 0 for hold).
Iterate through your data, checking for crossover conditions.

4- Visualize the Results:
matplotlib is excellent for plotting prices, MAs, and signals.

5- Calculate Basic Performance (Optional but good for showcase):
Track hypothetical buys and sells to calculate profit/loss. This is a very basic backtest.
GitHub Showcase:
A README.md file explaining the strategy, how to run the code, and what the plots show.
The Python script (.py file).
(Optional) A sample CSV data file if you're not using an API.
